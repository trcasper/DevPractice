// CODECADEMY PRACTICE ///////

// Use the console.log code in the editor to log your age to the console.

// 1.
// Use the console.log code in the editor to log your age to the console.

// Run your code when you are ready to see the result.

// console.log(29);

// 2.
// On the next line, log a number representing the number of weeks you’ve been programming.

// console.log(50);

// 1.
// Let’s practice adding some code comments.

// To the right, we’ve provided you with the beginning of the book Catch-22 by Joseph Heller.

// On line 1, write a single line comment that says Opening line.

// 2.
// Single line comments are great for adding context to your code. Multi-line comments are often best suited to prevent a block of code from running. However, both types of comments can be used for either purpose.

// Use a multi-line comment so that the console.log() statements on lines 4 - 9 are commented out.


// console.log('It was love at first sight.'); //Opening Line

// // console.log('The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.');
// // console.log('Yossarian was in the hospital with a pain in his liver that fell just short of being jaundice.');
// // console.log('The doctors were puzzled by the fact that it wasn\'t quite jaundice.');
// // console.log('If it became jaundice they could treat it.');
// // console.log('If it didn\'t become jaundice and went away they could discharge him.');
// // console.log('But this just being short of jaundice all the time confused them.');

// 1.
// On line 1, log the string 'JavaScript' to the console.

// 2.
// On line 2, log the number 2011 to the console.

// 3.
// On line 3, print 'Woohoo! I love to code! #codecademy' to the console.

// 4.
// On line 4, print the number 20.49 to the console.

// console.log("JavaScript");

// console.log(2011);

// console.log("Woohoo! I love to code! #codecademy");

// console.log(20.49);

// 1.
// Inside of a console.log(), add 3.5 to your age.

// This is the age you’ll be when we start sending people to live on Mars.

// 2.
// On a new line write another console.log(). Inside the parentheses, take the current year and subtract 1969.

// The answer is how many years it’s been since the 1969 moon landing.

// 3.
// Create another console.log(). Inside the parentheses divide 65 by 240.

// 4.
// Create one last console.log(). Inside the parentheses, multiply 0.2708 by 100.

// That’s the percent of the sun that is made up of helium. Assuming we could stand on the sun, we’d all sound like chipmunks!

// console.log(3.5 + 29);

// console.log(2020 - 1969);

// console.log(65 / 240);

// console.log(0.2708 * 100);

// 1.
// Inside a console.log() statement, concatenate the two strings 'Hello' and 'World'.

// Note: You should concatenate the two strings exactly (without introducing any additional characters).

// 2.
// We left off the space last time. Create a second console.log() statement in which you concatenate the strings 'Hello' and 'World', but this time make sure to also include a space (' ') between the two words.

// console.log("Hello" + "World");

// console.log("Hello" + " " + "World");

// 1.
// Use the .length property to log the number of characters in the following string to the console:

// 'Teaching the world how to code'

// console.log('Teaching the world how to code'.length);

// 1.
// Use the .toUpperCase() method to log the string 'Codecademy' to the console in all capital letters.

// 2.
// In the second console.log() statement in app.js, we have a string ' Remove whitespace ' which has spaces before and after the words 'Remove whitespace'.

// If we browse the JavaScript string documentation, we find several built-in string methods that each accomplish a different goal. The one method that seems ideal for us is .trim().

// Use the method to remove the whitespace at the beginning and end of the string in the second console.log() statement.

// // Use .toUpperCase() to log 'Codecademy' in all uppercase letters
// console.log('Codecademy'.toUpperCase());

// // Use a string method to log the following string without whitespace at the beginning and end of it.
// console.log('    Remove whitespace   '.trim());

// 1.
// Inside of a console.log(), create a random number with Math.random(), then multiply it by 100.

// 2.
// Now, use Math.floor() to make the output a whole number.

// Inside the console.log you wrote in the last step, put Math.random() * 100 inside the parentheses of Math.floor().
